        <h1>NARENDRA   DAMODARDAS   MODI!</h1>
        <h2>The only available Leader of INDIA since 2014!</h2>
        <DIV class="boxmodi">
        <P><B>NARENDRA MODI became prime minister of India in 2014 with a landslide victory attaining 272 seats alone for BJP and NDA gaining more than 300 seats in the lower house. This year was the start for the golder period of the BJP and subsequently the NDA. 
        The wave of MODI claimed as "MODI LAHAR" was seen in most of the states in INDIA which resulted in congress not even having a single seat in many states.The Indian general election, 2014 was held to constitute the 16th Lok Sabha, electing members of parliament for all 543 parliamentary constituencies. Running in nine phases from 7 April to 12 May 2014, it lasted 36 days.
        
        
        <br>
        
        
         According to the Election Commission of India, 814.5 million people were eligible to vote, with an increase of 100 million voters since the last general election in 2009,[5] making it the largest ever election in the world.[6] Around 23.1 million or 2.7% of the total eligible voters were aged 18–19 years.[7] A total of 8,251 candidates contested for the 543 Lok Sabha seats.[8] The average election turnout over all nine phases was around 66.40%, the highest ever in the history of Indian general elections.[8]

        The results were declared on 16 May 2014, 15 days before the 15th Lok Sabha completed its constitutional mandate on 31 May 2014.[9] The counting exercise was held at 989 counting centres.[8] The National Democratic Alliance won a sweeping victory, taking 336 seats. The BJP won 31.0% votes, which is the lowest share for a party to form a majority government in India since independence,[10] while NDA's combined vote share was 38.5%. BJP and its allies won the right to form the largest majority government since the 1984 general election, and it was the first time since that election that a party had won enough seats to govern without the support of other parties.[11][12][13] The United Progressive Alliance, led by the Indian National Congress, won 59 seats,[14] 44 (8.1%) of which were won by the Congress, that won 19.3% of all votes.[1][15] It was the Congress party's worst defeat in a general election. In order to become the official opposition party in India, a party must gain 10% of the seats (55 seats) in the Lok Sabha; however, the Indian National Congress was unable to attain this number. Due to this fact, India remains without an official opposition party, as of 2019</P>
        <br>
        
        <p>Modi became the brand of INDIA since then, in most of the states even the vidhan sabha elections were fought with the name of modi and the political acievements by bjp in center.The BJP’s rise to power can be attributed partly to Advani’s organisational skills, as well as the party’s return to the Hindutva agenda while keeping the liberal image of Vajpayee alive in popular memory. What further helped the party was the fact that the electorate wanted a change from the long years of Congress rule. Slogans like “Party with a difference” and an appeal to the electorate to give the BJP a chance captured the confidence of the electorate. A little over six years of the Vajpayee government, between 1998 and 2004, established the party as a credible alternative to the Congress. However, the BJP-led NDA lost the next two general elections due to various factors, making way for a Congress-led coalition, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), to run the government until a series of scams, high inflation and unemployment and policy paralysis grounded it in the 2014 elections. This time, the BJP was led by Modi, a four-time chief minister of Gujarat and the party’s prime ministerial candidate. He managed to capitalise on the popular discontent against the UPA government and won the party a majority, on its own, in Lok Sabha. The last time a party had won a majority on its own was when the Congress won 404 seats in the 1984 elections that followed the assassination of Indira Gandhi.

            Ever since Modi became prime minister on 26 May 2014, the BJP has been working like a well-oiled electoral machine. 
            
            
            It has won one state election after another and is dominating the national discourse like no other party has done in recent memory.
            
            Modi-Shah Partnership
            The rise of Modi has also marked the rise of Amit Shah as BJP president. Rajnath Singh, who headed the party in the run-up to the 2014 electoral victory, reportedly wanted to continue in the post and stay out of the government. But this was not acceptable to Modi as that could have meant a dual power centre.  Rajnath Singh had an excellent rapport with the RSS and that is why Modi did not want him to continue. The name of party General Secretary J P Nadda, a politician from Himachal Pradesh, was brought into contention and the RSS was agreeable to him. The move was made to juxtapose Shah against Nadda.  Modi resolved it by inducting Singh and Nadda into his cabinet and appointing Shah, his old and trusted colleague from Gujarat, as party president.[10]
            
            This was an exception to the long-held convention that the prime minister and the party president should come from different states. Shah has galvanised the party, bringing in a certain ruthlessness and unprecedented administrative acumen in the way the organisation is run. It is said that his party colleagues are more “in awe” of him than admiring.[11]
            
            Upon taking charge, Shah introduced many changes in the party’s administrative style and structure. He modernised the party set-up and developed a system that rewards individuals who deliver. He ushered in a corporate-style system of vertical heads for programmes, in contrast to the horizontal nature of the party under the previous presidents.[12]
            
            For Shah and the party, elections are “nothing less than war”. His advice to party colleagues after taking charge was: Elections are to be fought with clarity of mind and with the single objective of victory.[13] He enjoys the total support of Modi, stands firm in his decisions and brooks no interference from any leader. By most accounts, he has a no-nonsense style of leadership, and keeps a tight schedule and long hours of work, inspiring his team to follow suit.[14] Shah has also developed closer working relations with the RSS, as a result of which the RSS leadership and functionaries are playing a bigger role in running the oganisation.

                <h5>GUJARAT RIOTS 2002</h5>
                <P>On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[h] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[93][94] In making a public statement after the incident, Modi declared it a terrorist attack planned and orchestrated by local Muslims.[10][93][95] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh across the state.[96][97] Riots began during the bandh, and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[93][96][97] The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[93][98] The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.[99] Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000.[93][100] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[101] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women.[9][102]
        
                    The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots,[8][9][10] and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation. <img src="gujarat riots 2.jfif" alt="10" width="20%">

                    [103] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism.[104][105][106] Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: "There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law."[9] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating.[96][97] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time.[10] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[107] Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[108] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[9][95][109]
                    
                    Modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, Modi said that "What is happening is a chain of action and reaction."[9] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[110] In March 2008, the Supreme Court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[103][111][112] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi's complicity in the killings.[111] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[111][113] In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[114][115] The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister.

                <P>As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. <img src="download.jfif" alt="10" width="30%"> He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion were signed.[86]
        
                    The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[152] Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[153] As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India.[152] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[154] led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.[155] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4–6% of the area intended.[152] Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent – the highest of any state.[154] However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992–97 INC government was 12.9 percent.[156] In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata to Gujarat.[157]
                    
                    The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed.[156] Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised,[152] according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[158]

                <h3>CORONA AND MODI</h3>
                
                <P>
                    MODI was very supportive to the people of INDIA and energetic to curve the first wave of covid19 in INDIA, which resulted 
                    in the maximum cases going up to 97900 and subsequently coming down after that, this was the great success to stop the covid surge
                    in the nos. less than 1 lakh in a country whose population is more than 135 crores.
                    but the real test of modi came in the second wave when country was sent to cross it's peak during the first wave, but what the people 
                    of INDIA saw was a very different approach of NARENDRA MODI towards the second wave. <img src="modi-dp.webp" alt="10" width="20%">
                    When the country was going to touch 2 lakh cases 
                    per day prime minister NARENDRA MODI was busy doing election rallies in west bengal, which was subsequently the toughest battle for the BJP-led
                    and NDA to win. People of INDIA were very sad with the approach of MODI towards the second wave, which gave an advantage to MAMATA DIDI 
                    over the BJP, resulting in TMC getting 3-4 seats more as compared to the previous vidhan sabha elections. BJP though got seats as compared 
                    to their previous performance but the seats they got were the seats of congress and CPI, which resulted in BJP going up from 2 seats to 87 seats 
                    and CPI+ INC coming down from 87 to 0 seats. 

                    Starting of the month of may were very challenging for people of INDIA with covid cases touching 4 lakhs and their supreme leader being unresponsive.
                    People were starving to get a hospital bed and medical oxygen for their dear once. <div class="box"> This wave gave the people of INDIA the real
                    meaning of being <b>"AATMNIRBHAR"</b> which was the mantra given by PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI during the first wave of covid19 in INDIA.</div>

                        <p>The country fought the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic “courageously” and it would be “victorious” in its ongoing fight against the virus during the second wave, PM Narendra Modi said on Sunday.
                
                            “In the form of the corona pandemic, we are being continuously put to test. This is a crisis that has plagued the whole world, so many people have lost their loved ones. Even big countries were not spared from its devastation,” Modi said in his monthly radio programme ‘Mann ki Baat’.
                            He emphasised that no matter how big the challenge, the country’s ‘vijay sankalp’ (resolve to be victorious) had always been equal to the challenge. “Our collective strength and our spirit of service has always rescued the country from the midst of every storm,” he said.
                            During the programme, he spoke to three people involved with transporting oxygen cylinders and containers through rail, road and airways, and listened to their experience and challenges during the recent crisis when many parts of the country faced severe shortage of medical-grade oxygen. He also pointed to the government completing seven years in office and highlighted signature initiatives, including power connections to all households and the Jal Jeevan mission to provide tap water to all rural homes. “In the midst of this pandemic, India is moving forward with the resolve of service and cooperation,” he added.
                            Modi pointed to the scheme to provide tap water connection to every rural household in the country by 2024 under Jal Jeevan Mission and said it had made strong progress without any break during the pandemic. “In the seven decades after independence, only 3.5 crore rural homes of our country had water connections. However, in the last 21 months, 4.5 crore houses have been given clean water connections. Of these, 15 months were of the corona period,” he added.
                            The PM also noted the contribution of farmers and the agriculture sector during the pandemic. “The agricultural sector protected itself from this attack to a great extent. Not only did it keep itself safe, but the sector also progressed, moving forward. Farmers produced record output and this time, the country went on to procure record amounts of crops. This time, in many places, farmers have got more than the minimum support price for mustard,” he said.
                            Noting that India was able to provide support to every citizen due to record foodgrain production, he said, “Today, 800 million underprivileged citizens are being provided free ration in this hour of crisis. So, no such day ever occurs in a needy home when the stove is not lit.”
